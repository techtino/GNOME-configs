## Gsettings I want

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-applications "['<Alt>Tab']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-windows "['<Super>Tab']"

These are due to the extension I use for alt-tab mouse focusing only working on switch-windows (this actually is a benefit as sometimes I don't want the mouse to move anyway)

# I want to focus the window that my mouse is currently on
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences focus-mode 'sloppy'
